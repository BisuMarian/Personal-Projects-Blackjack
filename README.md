The Blackjack game is a single player game in which the user is dealt a first hand of two cards and it's up to his decision if he wants to draw another card or if he wants to hold his hand and then compare it to the hand of the house.

To develop this game I created a player class, which contains a multitude of attributes and methods which are used to manage the betting feature of the game, the funds of the player, the cards that were assigned to the player and to check if the player wins or loses. The game also uses libraries such as random and math to create and shuffle a deck of cards and to calculate the value of certain variables like the score of a player's hand or the approximated won amount.
